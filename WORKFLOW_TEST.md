# Workflow Test

This file demonstrates the new GitHub workflow in action.

## What We Tested

1. ✅ Created `develop` branch
2. ✅ Set develop as default branch for PRs
3. ✅ Added PR template
4. ✅ Added issue templates (bug report & feature request)
5. ✅ Created feature branch: `feature/demo-workflow-test`
6. ✅ Made changes on feature branch
7. ✅ Created PR to merge back to develop

## The Workflow Works!

From now on, all development follows:
```
feature/your-feature → develop → main → Production
```

This ensures:
- All changes are reviewed
- Tests run automatically
- Production stays stable
- Easy rollback if needed
