ADR-001,Coordinate transforms live in AIME backend,LOCKED,P0,,,All WGS84→projected→green_local transforms run in FastAPI backend; frontend and putt service do not.,No lat/lon accepted by putt service; frontend never performs transforms; backend logs transform version + request_id.,contracts/docs/coordinate-frames.md
ADR-002,PuttSolver Service accepts dtm_id + green_local_m only (no paths),LOCKED,P0,,,Service accepts dtm_id allowlist + local coords + stimp; resolves dtm_id to local path internally.,Requests containing path-like fields are rejected; unknown dtm_id returns 4xx; resolved file is inside DATA_ROOT.,contracts/schemas/solve_putt.request.schema.json
ADR-003,Model calls one tool: get_hole_advice; backend routes,LOCKED,P0,,,Model does not pick solver; backend decides tee-to-green vs putt based on hole state.,Realtime tools include get_hole_advice; backend returns plan_type union; UI renders based on plan_type.,contracts/schemas/hole_state.schema.json
