"Create contracts folder structure in AIME repo (/contracts/docs, /contracts/schemas, /contracts/samples)",0,0A,Backlog,P0,,,Repo contains /contracts with docs/schemas/samples; committed to main branch.,Gate 0
"Define contract versioning rules (contract_version, breaking vs additive changes) in contracts/versioning.md",0,0A,Backlog,P0,,Create contracts folder structure,versioning.md defines version format and bump rules; referenced by all schemas/samples.,Gate 0
"Write coordinate frames specification (wgs84, projected_m, green_local_m) including origin + axis + rotation conventions",0,0A,Backlog,P0,,Create contracts folder structure,"coordinate-frames.md documents units, axes, origin corner, rotation sign; open questions explicitly marked BLOCKING.",Gate 0
Draft green_manifest JSON Schema (green_manifest.schema.json),0,0A,Backlog,P0,,Coordinate frames specification,"Schema exists under /contracts/schemas and includes required fields (dtm_id, grid_spacing_m, rows/cols, no_data_value, transform metadata).",Gate 0
Create Riverside green_manifest sample from Ovation ini + grid dims (green_manifest.riverside_2023.json),0,0A,Backlog,P0,,green_manifest schema,Sample validates against schema and includes actual ini-derived values + derived extents (rows/cols×spacing).,Gate 0
Draft PuttSolver Service API schemas: solve_putt.request/response JSON Schemas,0,0A,Backlog,P0,,Coordinate frames specification; green_manifest schema,Request uses dtm_id + ball/cup in green_local_m; Response includes instruction_text + plot points + raw return code + request_id.,Gate 0
Draft AIME tool schemas: tool.solve_putt args + output JSON Schemas,0,0A,Backlog,P0,,Coordinate frames specification; solve_putt service schemas,Args use course_id/hole_id + ball/cup wgs84; Output contains instruction_text + overlay (green_local_m) + request_id + dtm_id.,Gate 0
Define HoleState schema (hole_state.schema.json) used across Tee→Green→Cup routing,0,0A,Backlog,P1,,Coordinate frames specification,"Schema covers course/hole, ball/cup (wgs84 + optional local), stimp, surface_state, dtm_id, timestamps.",Gate 0
Define standard Error schema (error.schema.json) + error_code taxonomy draft,0,0A,Backlog,P1,,,"Schema exists and includes request_id, component, error_code, message; used by backend and services.",Gate 0
Create golden sample payloads (tool args → backend req → service req → service resp → tool output) in /contracts/samples,0,0A,Backlog,P0,,All schemas above,All sample JSON files validate against schemas; uses Riverside dtm_id and plausible in-bounds coords.,Gate 0
"Create runtime matrix doc (runtime-matrix.md) for AIME, Ovation, PuttSolver Service + dependencies",0,0B,Backlog,P1,,,Doc lists OS/arch constraints and known runtime deps; unknowns explicitly listed as questions.,Gate 0
"Schedule + run developer blockers interview; capture answers in Notion (coordinate frame, DTMPath format, instruction format, plot dims, thread safety)",0,0B,Backlog,P0,,Notion question bank page,Answers documented; any unknowns converted into explicit acceptance tests/validation steps.,Gate 0
Gate 0 Review: verify contracts exist + unresolved blockers clearly tagged; approve moving to Phase 1/2 scaffolding,0,0A/0B,Backlog,P0,,Complete Phase 0 tasks,All required schemas/samples exist; coordinate conventions documented; dtm_id allowlist decision locked; remaining unknowns listed with plan.,Gate 0
